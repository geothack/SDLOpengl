Hello fellow game devs!

Simple start of an OpenGl using SDL project!

This project contains model loading, shaders & textures!

I was more trying to learn how CMake works here and ive had a blast.


TODO please make a build directory inside the game folder 

Run cmake inside that folder using cmake ../

Build the project using cmake --build .

Run the executable inside the Deubg folder.

The project will run inside visual studio but object dependencies like model, shaders & textures are pathed to run through the executbale.

Enjoy.
